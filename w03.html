<h1>Lemonade Stand </h1>

    <p>A duck walked up to a lemonade stand
And he said to the man runnin' the stand
"Hey! [(bam bam bam)] Got any grapes?"
The man said: "No, we just sell lemonade
But it's cold, and it's fresh, and it's all home-made!
Can I get you a glass?"
The duck said, "I'll pass."
Then he waddled away - waddle waddle</p>
