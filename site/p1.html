    <h2>What is theory debate?</h2>
    <p>
      Theory debate is about creating the best supposed "norms" for the community to make the space more educational and fair. These rules aren't actually enacted in the community. Theory debates are highly technical, but generic on each topic. They also account for out of round impacts.

    <h2>Format of a Theory Shell</h2>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Interpretation: what rule you are proposing ex: debaters may not wear shoes in round</li>
        <li>Violation: how the other debater doesn't fulfill this rule ex: they wear shoes</li>
        <li>Standards: the reasons why your rule is good in debate! Some common standards are:<ul>
          <li>Clash: how your argument interacts with your opponent's</li>
          <li>Ground: how much of the topic you're able to access</li>
          <li>Portability: how much good the interpretation does in the real world</li>
          <li>Research Skills: does the interpretation contribute to higher quality research for cases?</li>
          <li>Topic Ed: how much do we learn about the topic from a world with your interpretation?</li>
          <li>Aff/Negflex: how much unfair prep before the round is skewed towards the aff or neg</li>
          <li>Time Skew: the violation the opponent commits skews the time allocation of my speeches somehow</li>
          <li>Strat Skew: the violation the opponent commits skews the strategy I have for the round somehow</li>
          <li>Phil Ed: provides unique value to the philosophical style of LD</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Paradigm Issues:<ol>
          <li>Competing Interpretations: the other debater must propose a counterinterpretation - countered by reasonability with a brightline</li>
          <li>Education and Fairness: how the standards cause education and/or fairness, and why these are good for debate</li>
          <li>No RVIs (Reverse Voting Issues): if I lose the shell, I don't lose the round - the opponent reads RVIs so if they win the shell they win the round</li>
          <li>DTD (Drop the Debater): if you win the shell, the other debater loses vs. DTA (Drop the Argument): goes to a different layer of debate and ignores the shell if they win dta</li>
        </ol></ol></p>
