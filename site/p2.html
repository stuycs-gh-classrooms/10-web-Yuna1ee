<h3>Types of Ks</h3>
<p>
  <li>Language K: criticizes the language the aff uses</li>
  <li>Epist K: criticizes the assumptions the aff makes about the world - we’re real</li>

Postmodernism: skepticism of generalizations in society (Ex: economy and politics)
<ol>
  <li>Nietzsche: god is dead</li>
  <li>Baudrillard: we’re living in a simulation</li>
  <li>Nihilism: no meaning to life</li>
</ol>
Psychoanalysis: investigation of how people think (think Freud: id, ego, superego)
Nonpess mindset: criticizes the aff’s mindset without being for one group
</p>
<h3>Parts of a K</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Theory of Power<ul><li>Criticism about the world/society</li><li>Usually really flowery language that comes straight from the card</li></ul></li>
  <li>Link: what the aff does wrong, how they cause the theory of power to happen, and carded!</li>
  <li>Impact: the problem of this mindset that the theory of power has (ex: causes indigenous genocide) but usually not extinction impacts</li>
  <li>Alternative (Alt)<ul><li>What we should do instead to solve this issue that is presented in the theory of power</li><li>the counterplan, sometimes in the form of a pik (like a pic)</li><li>not usually material</li></ul></li>
  <li>Role of the Ballot (ROTB): framework/the lens the judge should evaluate the round under<li>Different from structural violence because applies to one group specifically</li></li>
</ol>

    <h2>How to Cope with Ks - FPOSTAL!!</h2>
    <p>
<li>1] Framework: extinction outweighs - you HAVE to win this</li>
<li>2] Perms</li>
<li>3] Offense: link turns - impact turns are iffy cause the impacts are usually true</li>
<li>4] Solvency: their alt can’t solve for their k</li>
<li>5] Theory: specific to the k (Ex: vague alts)</li>
<li>6] Alt fails: makes their theory of power and impacts happen more (pos. feedback loop)</li>
<li>7] Link: the aff doesn’t have this mindset/this issue</li>
<li>Nonunique: both sides have this issue and there’s no determining factor</li>
<li>Truth testing: do they negate the resolution?</li>
