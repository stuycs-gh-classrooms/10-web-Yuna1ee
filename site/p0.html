    <h2>What is LARP?</h2>
    <p>
      LARP, or Live Action Role Play, is a form of policy debate that has trickled down to LD. It operates under comparative worlds, which is comparing whose imagined world is better using weighing mechanisms. Common frameworks are consequentialist (util) - util is trutil!!

    <h2>Aff Larping</h2>
    <p>
Aff reads plans - what they want to do - uniqueness, link, internal link, impact
<li>Replace contentions with advantages and add a plan advocacy (an author advocating the plan)</li>
<li>Whole res plantext: “Plan: the united states ought to substantially decrease our military presence in WANA”</li>
<li>Subset plantext: “Plan: the united states ought to substantially decrease our military presence in Bahrain” - subject to T violations (not defending the whole res)</li>
</p>

    <h3>Types of Affs</h3>
    <p>
<li>Hard Right/Big Stick: extinction high magnitude scenarios, hegemony, china/russia</li>
<li>Soft Left: focuses on structural issues (ex: solving indigenous harms) and use k lit but enact policies and use the government as an actor<li>
<li>does not use structural violence winter and leighton as a framing, but specific authors that are experts in advocating for that specific minority group</li>
<li>usually somewhat extra topical (defend the resolution and something additional), but pretend they aren’t</li>
K Affs: advocate for a certain critical literature base INSTEAD of arguing the resolution cause that base is more important
<li>definitely non-topical</li>
</p>

<h2>Neg Larping</h2>
<p>
  Neg reads disadvanatages (disads) and counterplans (cps), each in place of a "contention"
  <li>should link to the aff and be topical!!</li>
</p>
  <h3>Disadvanatages</h3>
  <p>
Separate harms or things the aff will lead to (weigh vs advantages)
<li>Linear: the aff makes an already bad situation worse</li>
  ex: the aff decreasing military presence means we’re less able to counter militant violence without US military troop help/special forces
<li>Brink: we do the aff and it pushes us over a brightline at one point in time which has high mag</li>
</p>
      </div>
      <div class="larp3">
<h3>Counterplans</h3>
<p>
  **Counterplans should be condo - this means you can kick them in the 2nr!!
PIC: plan inclusive counterplan
<li>Process: plan but with different process</li>
<li>Agent: change who is doing that plan and why this is better</li>
<li>Consult: consult someone and find benefit for it and they say yes (need evidence) - permission so disadvantage doesn’t happen and we have net benefit</li>
<li>Exception: do everything except one thing and why this is better</li>
<li>Delay: delay in time and why this is better</li>
</p>
<h4>Answering Counterplans - SPLOT</h4>
<p>
<li>1]Solvency Deficit: the counterplan doesn’t solve for the aff better</li>
<li>2]Perms - test if the cp is competitive “[type of perm], what it does, net benefit”</li>
<li>Legit: does the aff and cp, or the aff and part of the cp</li>
<li>Severance: does part of the aff and cp</li>
<li>Double Bind: either the cp can’t solve or the cp is so fire it solves any aff harms by perming</li>
<li>Intrinsic: does the aff, cp, and something additional (carded)</li>
<li>Timeframe: do the aff, then the cp by an amount of time</li>
<li>3] Link to the net benefit - does the aff also have the net benefit?</li>
<li>4] Offense - turns</li>
<li>5] Theory - condo bad, pic specific counterplan theory</li>
