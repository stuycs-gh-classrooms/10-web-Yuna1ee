   <h2>What is Progressive Debate?</h2>
   <p>
     Progressive Debate comes from policy debate. It is done in varsity LD, usually with student judges that have done it before. It is also known as circuit debate, because many debaters that use this kind of debate compete on the national circuit as compared to local circuits.
     This site will give an overview of each style of progressive debate, or "prog", but to learn more go to the links above!

     <h2>What is the TOC, and why do people want to compete at it?</h2>
     <p>
       The TOC, also known as the Tournament of Champions, is a prestigious debate tournament in Kentucky. Debaters must win a certain number of rounds at other prestigious tournaments such as Harvard and Princeton. Once they have two of these "bids", they qualify.
